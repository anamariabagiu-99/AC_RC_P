The prank.Everybody  was  sitting  on  sleeping  bags,  Alaska  smoking with flagrant disregard for the overwhelming flammability of  the  structure,  when  the  Colonel  pulled  out  a  single piece of computer paper and read from it. “The point of this evening’s festivities is to prove once and  for  all  that  we  are  to  pranking  what  the  Weekday Warriors  are  to  sucking.  But  we’ll  also  have  the  opportu-nity to make life unpleasant for the Eagle, which is always a  welcome  pleasure. And  so,”  he  said,  pausing  as  if  for  a drumroll, “we fight tonight a battle on three fronts: “Front One: The pre-prank: We will, as it were, light a fire under the Eagle’s ass. “Front Two: Operation Baldy: Wherein Lara flies solo in a retaliatory mission so elegant and cruel that it could only have been the brainchild of, well, me.” “Hey!” Alaska interrupted. “It was my idea!” “Okay,  fine.  It  was  Alaska’s  idea.”  He  laughed.  “And finally, Front Three: The Progress Reports: We’re going to hack  into  the  faculty  computer  network  and  use  their grading database to send out letters to Kevin et al.’s fami-lies saying that they are failing some of their classes.” “We are definitely going to get expelled,” I said. “I  hope  you  didn’t  bring  the  Asian  kid  along  thinking he’s a computer genius. Because I am not,” Takumi said. “We’re not going to get expelled, and I’m the computer genius. The rest of you are muscle and distraction. We’re just, you know, wreaking a little havoc.”
