5 I  mulled  it  over  for  a  moment,  careful  not  to  look  at  her.  “Uh, no,” I said. “Well, why then?” she asked. This was not the first time she had posed the question. Mom was not particularly keen on letting me go to boarding school and had made no secret of it. “Because of me?” my dad asked. He had attended Culver Creek, the same boarding school to which I was headed, as had both of his brothers  and  all  of  their  kids.  I  think  he  liked  the  idea  of  me  fol-lowing in his footsteps. My uncles had told me stories about how famous  my  dad  had  been  on  campus  for  having  simultaneously raised hell and aced all his classes.

I  was  after  a  Great  Perhaps,  and  they knew as well as I did that I wasn’t going to find it with the likes of Will and Marie. I sat back down on the couch, between my mom and  my  dad,  and  my  dad  put  his  arm  around  me,  and  we  stayed there like that, quiet on the couch together, for a long time, until it seemed okay to turn on the TV, and then we ate artichoke dip for dinner and watched the History Channel, and as going-away parties go, it certainly could have been w
